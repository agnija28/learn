## Notes
This first analysis goal is to understand a bit more what data I'm working with.
As outlined in this thread on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci/discussion/105877) the data as it stands is a bit flawed. The future analysis should take the original dataset without the heavy processing that was done.

The first EDA however will be run on that dataset first, as it is easier to use.

## Features
Here is a brief description of each of the features I am working with

### Age
The minimum age is 29 years old and the maximum age is 77. Most of the ages are in the 50s range, there is a standard deviation of about 9 y/o.

### Sex

### Chest Pain (cp)

### Resting Blood Pressure (trestbps)

### Serum Cholestoral (chol)

### Fasting Blood Sugar (fbs)

### Resting ECG (restecg)

### Maximum Heart Rate (thalach)

### Exercise Induced Angina (exang)

### Old Peak (oldpeak) (?)
TODO: find more information about this feature as the snippet description doesn't make much sense.

### Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment (slope)

### Fluoroscopy Result (ca)

### (thal) (?)
TODO: find more information about this feature as the snippet description doesn't make much sense.

## Interactions
This is the section where we outline some meaningful interactions between pair of features.

## PCA Vizualization
This is the section where we put the result of doing a PCA on the dataset and vizualizing it in 3D and 2D.

## KNN Result
This is the section where we show if a KNN with a number of clusters (5) that will match the label in `Chest Pain (cp)`. We will also be able to see how far the clustering is from the labelling by calculating the "error".

## Conclusion
This is the section where we summarize whatever we found here.

## Next Steps
This is where we should outline the next steps for this analysis.
