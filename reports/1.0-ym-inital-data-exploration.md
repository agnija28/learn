## Notes
This first analysis goal is to understand a bit more what data I'm working with.
As outlined in this thread on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci/discussion/105877) the data as it stands is a bit flawed. The future analysis should take the original dataset without the heavy processing that was done.

The first EDA however will be run on that dataset first, as it is easier to use.
